## Project Overview
Ksana Rental is a full-stack web application built entirely by **me** using Next.js with TypeScript. From design to deployment, this solo project showcases my skills in web development and my ability to manage both the frontend and backend.

## Project Background
As someone who practices spinning hammock, I often need to rent spaces for practice. Every time, I have to message the studio via Instagram DM to ask if the space is available, then wait for a reply. It’s not always clear what studios are available for rent, and sometimes double bookings happen.

From the studio owner’s side, managing bookings manually takes a lot of time — replying to every inquiry and sending out door codes by hand can be quite troublesome.

This website aims to streamline the entire process: users can easily check which studios are available and book them directly. The door code will be visible on the platform 2 hours before the booking starts, so owners don’t have to send it manually. This reduces miscommunication and helps both renters and studio owners save time.
