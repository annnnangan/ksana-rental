## Project Overview
Ksana Rental is a full-stack web application built entirely by **me** using Next.js with TypeScript. From design to deployment, this solo project showcases my skills in web development and my ability to manage both the frontend and backend.

## Project Background
As someone who practices spinning hammock, I often need to rent spaces for practice. Every time, I have to message the studio via Instagram DM to ask if the space is available, then wait for a reply. It’s not always clear what studios are available for rent, and sometimes double bookings happen.

From the studio owner’s side, managing bookings manually takes a lot of time — replying to every inquiry and sending out door codes by hand can be quite troublesome.

This website aims to streamline the entire process: users can easily check which studios are available and book them directly. The door code will be visible on the platform 2 hours before the booking starts, so owners don’t have to send it manually. This reduces miscommunication and helps both renters and studio owners save time.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js with Typescript
- **AI Chatbot**: Copilotkit
- **Style:** Tailwind, Shadcn UI
- **Data Fetching & Caching:** React Query
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Form & Validation**: React Hook Form with Zod
- **Database:** Postgres, Knex
- **Authentication:** Next Auth
- **Payment**: Stripe
- **Email**: React Email with Resend
- **Image Storage**: AWS S3
- **Deployment:** AWS (EC2, Route53), Docker

## Payment Notes
Stripe is in test mode so you could use the test card [here](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards) to complete the booking.

- In the example below, although the studio is generally unavailable for booking on Mondays, it has specifically opened timeslots for May 5th. When users view the booking calendar, they will see that only May 5th (a Monday) has available timeslots.
